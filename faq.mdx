# FAQ

## Should docs live inside the Yocto layer repo?

Usually no. Keeping docs in a dedicated docs repo keeps Yocto metadata clean and makes publishing simpler.

## What should I customize first?

- A product layer with `.bbappend` overrides
- A packagegroup that represents your product feature set
- CI scripts that pin exact versions and capture metadata

## How do I keep builds reproducible?

- Pin manifest XML, branches, and layer tags
- Cache `DL_DIR` and `SSTATE_DIR`
- Publish build metadata and checksums with artifacts

## Can I add my own application?

Yes. Add a new recipe in your product layer and include it via packagegroup or `IMAGE_INSTALL:append`.

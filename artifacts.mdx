# Generate SDK Artifacts

## Build command

```bash
bitbake qcom-qim-product-sdk
```

## Output location

The layer documents an artifacts directory under the build deploy tree. In many setups you’ll see something like:

```text
<release>/build-<distro>/tmp-*/deploy/qim_prod_sdk_artifacts/
```

## What’s typically inside

- SDK headers and libraries
- plugin binaries and dependencies
- sample applications / pipelines
- scripts to install/uninstall (varies by release)

## Recommended artifact publishing

- Compress artifacts per build id:
  ```bash
  tar -C <artifacts-dir> -czf qim_sdk_artifacts_<build>.tar.gz .
  ```
- Publish with checksums (sha256) and the exact manifest/layer tag metadata.

# Flash the Image

Flashing steps vary by board (RB3 Gen 2, Vision Kit, etc.) and BSP release.

## Before you flash

Capture:
- the exact manifest XML name
- `repo manifest -r` output
- layer tags/commits
- image file names from `deploy/images/<machine>/`

## Common pitfalls

- Using an image built for a different `MACHINE`
- Mismatched boot firmware vs rootfs release
- Missing EULA acceptance flags (if applicable)

## Recommended practice

Keep a `flash/` runbook per board in your organization that maps:
- host tools versions
- board switch settings
- commands
- recovery steps

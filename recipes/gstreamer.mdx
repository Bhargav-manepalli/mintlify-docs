# GStreamer & Multimedia

## Where to look

- `recipes-gst/` contains multimedia and GStreamer related recipes.

## Runtime validation checklist

On target:

```bash
gst-inspect-1.0 | head
```

If plugins are missing:
- confirm packages installed
- confirm plugin path and `GST_PLUGIN_PATH`
- verify dependencies are present

## Creating a minimal test pipeline

Start with a simple pipeline that exercises the relevant plugin set, then evolve to a full use-case.

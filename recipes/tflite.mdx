# TensorFlow Lite / LiteRT

## Where to look

- `recipes-tensorflow-lite/` contains recipes to package TFLite/LiteRT components.

## Versioning best practices

- Keep versions aligned with the BSP release
- Avoid mixing runtime versions across major releases
- Prefer vendor-provided tags in production

## Quick checks on target

```bash
ls -l /usr/lib | grep -i tflite || true
```

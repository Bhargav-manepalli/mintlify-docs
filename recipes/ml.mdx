# ML Components

## Where to look

- `recipes-qcom-ml/` typically holds recipes for ML runtimes, delegates, and accelerators.

## Validation approach

- Verify libraries exist under `/usr/lib` (or distro equivalent)
- Run provided sample apps/pipelines
- Compare performance (CPU vs accelerator)

## Troubleshooting

- Check that the correct delegate/runtime is installed
- Confirm the model format is supported by your runtime
- Collect runtime logs and pipeline caps negotiation details

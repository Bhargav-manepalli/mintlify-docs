# Recipes Overview

This layer groups recipes by domain (multimedia, ML, SDK aggregation, and support).

## How to inspect a recipe

```bash
bitbake -e <recipe> | less
```

## How to extend without forking

Create a `.bbappend` in your product layer that matches the recipe name/version:

```text
meta-yourproduct/
  recipes-gst/
    qtiqmmfsrc/
      qtiqmmfsrc_%.bbappend
```

Then add patches or variable overrides.

## How to find which recipe provides a file

```bash
oe-pkgdata-util find-path /usr/lib/<something>.so
```

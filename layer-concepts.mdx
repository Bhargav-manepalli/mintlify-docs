# Layer Concepts

## Recipes

A **recipe** (`.bb`) describes how to fetch, configure, build, and package a component.

## Packagegroups

A **packagegroup** aggregates multiple packages into one install target, usually to make image composition easy.

## Images

An **image recipe** defines the root filesystem composition. When you build `qcom-multimedia-image`, you’re building an image recipe that pulls in packagegroups and packages.

## Artifacts target

A dedicated target like `qcom-qim-product-sdk` typically gathers and stages deliverables (headers, libs, samples, docs) into a deploy directory suitable for SDK distribution.

## Prebuilt vs source

Many vendor layers provide some components as prebuilts for reproducibility and licensing reasons. When you want source builds, look for:
- alternative recipes
- build flags in `conf/`
- `.bbappend` hooks

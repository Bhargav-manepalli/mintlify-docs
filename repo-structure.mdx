# Repository Structure

`meta-qcom-qim-product-sdk` follows standard Yocto layer conventions:

- `conf/` — layer configuration and compatibility
- `classes/` — shared packaging and integration helpers
- `recipes-*/` — BitBake recipes grouped by domain
  - `recipes-gst/` — multimedia / GStreamer components
  - `recipes-qcom-ml/` — machine-learning components
  - `recipes-tensorflow-lite/` — TensorFlow Lite / LiteRT packaging
  - `recipes-qim-product-sdk/` — product SDK aggregation and artifacts
  - `recipes-support/` — support packages
  - `recipes-devtools/` — build/dev tools (example: protobuf)

## Recommended customization pattern

Prefer one of these approaches:

1. **Create a product layer** (recommended): `meta-yourproduct`
   - Add `.bbappend` files and configs without forking vendor layers.
2. If you must fork, keep the fork minimal and track upstream tags.

## Where to start when debugging

- Add `bitbake -e <recipe> | less` to inspect variables.
- Use `bitbake -g <target>` to generate dependency graphs.
- Inspect `tmp/work/<machine>/<recipe>/<version>/temp/log.do_*` for failures.
